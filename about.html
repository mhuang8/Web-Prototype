          <p>Clean Up Australia inspires and empowers communities to clean up and conserve our environment. Today, our focus is as much on preventing rubbish entering our environment as it is removing what has already accumulated.</p>

        <h2>Australia's Waste Problem</h2>
        <p>Australians produce approximately 540kg of household waste per person each year, totalling to approximately 67 million tonnes of waste. It is estimated that 130 000 tonnes of this ends up in our waterways and oceans each year! Rubbish is also significantly polluting our Australian beaches, coasts, parks, rivers, as well as other local areas.</p>
        <p>Issues such as food waste, e-waste, fast fashion, packaging, plastics and single-use items are all part of the waste problem that negatively impacts our environment. It's time for us to step up and support solutions which move us towards a circular economy. </p>
        <p><strong>Change starts with you. How will you step up?</strong></p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>What was started thirty years ago, by an "average Australian bloke" who had a simple idea to make a difference in his own backyard has now become the nation's largest community-based environmental event.</p>
        <p>This initiative began as the inspiration of one man, Ian Kiernan. An avid sailor, Ian was shocked and disgusted by the pollution and rubbish that he continually encountered in the oceans of the world. Taking matters into his own hands, Ian organised a community event with the support of a committee of friends, including co-founder Kim McKay AO.</p>
        <p>This simple idea ignited an enthusiasm and desire among the local community to get involved and make a difference. If a capital city could be mobilised into action, then so could the whole nation! And so it was that Clean Up Australia Day was born in 1990.</p>
        <p>Of course, Australia's waste challenges can't be solved in just one day, so over the past three decades, Clean Up Australia has evolved into an organisation that works with community, government and businesses to clean up and provide practical solutions to help us all live more sustainably every day of the year. Our story will continue to grow with your help and support - join us and be a part of the journey.</p>
